            📬 <b class="bold">Contact Us</b> — Let’s Build the Scene Together

    Cleveland Hip Hop Magazine is more than just a publication — it's a platform created to represent every voice pushing the culture forward in the 216. This section is for you — the creatives, the movers, and the true supporters of the scene. If you're part of Cleveland's music culture in any way, shape, or form, we want to hear from you.<br></p>

    <p>🎶 <b class="bold">Artists</b> — Submit Your Music
    Been grinding in the studio? Dropped a new single, EP, or visual? Ready to get your name out there? We’re always on the lookout for local talent to feature in our magazine. Whether you're brand new or a veteran of the city, this is your chance to get covered and heard. Send us your music along with a short artist bio, press photos, links, and anything else that tells your story. We want to spotlight raw, real voices coming straight outta the Land.<br></p>

    <p>🎧 <b class="bold">DJs</b> — Show Love to the Scene
    Are you a DJ spinning local records, throwing events, or curating vibes across the city? We want to support you too. Share your mixes, events, residencies, or thoughts on the evolving sound of Cleveland hip hop. Let us know where you’ll be next, and we might just pull up, show love, and shine a light on what you do.<br></p>

    <p>📅 <b class="bold">Event Organizers & Promoters</b> — Spread the Word
    If you’re throwing a hip hop show, battle rap event, open mic, cypher, listening party, or any gathering that supports the music scene — let us help promote it. We’ll share the details, highlight key performers, and possibly even provide on-site coverage. We’re all about building bridges and bringing energy to the events that give the city life.<br></p>

    <p>🎤 <b class="bold">Creatives, Brands, and Anyone Looking for Publicity</b>
    This isn’t just for rappers and DJs. If you're a beatmaker, studio owner, videographer, fashion designer, blogger, community leader, or someone creating within or around the culture, we want to connect. If you’re based in Cleveland and your work touches the hip hop community — this is your outlet.<br></p>
